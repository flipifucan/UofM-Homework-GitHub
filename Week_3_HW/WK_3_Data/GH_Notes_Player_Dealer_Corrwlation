I found that the player Mylie Schmidt and the dealer Billy Jones were playing at the times of major losses. Together these two individuals were at the tables at the the times of losses, I compared with by pulling the data from the records. By first pulling the times that losses occured and then by pulling losses that the Roulette dealer made. Because Billy Jones was the most hits on this data on (Roulette) and Mylie Schmidt being hit the most as a player my findings for these two are solid. Hello world!
